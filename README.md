# Profit Analysis for Beverages 2011

In this project I used a dataset which contains information about sales values in dollars on American Stores between 2010 and 2011.
I created a notebook where I cleaned the dataset and I used 4 different style libraries, aquarel, mplcatppuccin, mplcyberpunk and matplotx, for building dashboards.

Plus, I made a profit dashboard for all the different beverages that this dataset had.
