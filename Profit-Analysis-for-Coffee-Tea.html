          <br>
          <br>For all the stores combined we can see that the total profit for coffee types is 44.125 $, where the 76% of this profit derives from Columbian coffee.<br>One more positive outcome is that expenses had a dicrease of 1,02%.<br>Moreover, profit was increased by 18% compared to the profit from previous year.<br>Most coffee lovers in USA, live in New York, Colorado and Illinois. (They produce together the 30% of the total profit).

          <br>
